# Task 013: Brainstorm Phase 2 Implementation

**Type:** Task
**Status:** In Progress
**Created:** 2026-02-11

## Context

Phase 1: Local Skeleton has been completed, providing a foundational end-to-end event flow. The project is now transitioning to Phase 2: Local Full Stack. This task initiates a brainstorming session to detail the implementation plan for Phase 2, including identifying specific technologies, architectural considerations, and potential design ramifications.

## Changes

-   Review the existing goals for Phase 2 as defined in `platform-docs/PROJECT.md`.
-   Brainstorm specific implementation steps for each goal.
-   Identify potential architectural challenges or decisions required.
-   Consider the impact on the current system design.
-   Document initial thoughts and decisions, potentially leading to further tasks or spec documents.

## Verification

-   Initial brainstorming notes are captured (e.g., in this task document or linked sub-documents).
-   A clear understanding of the next steps for Phase 2 implementation is established.
-   [ ] Update PROJECT.md (or other relevant high-level progress tracking document) to reflect task completion, if applicable.
